/**
 * Implementation of the Repository interface that takes provides a locking mechanism to prevent concurrent
 * modifications of persisted aggregates. Unless there is a locking mechanism present in the underlying persistence
 * environment, it is recommended to use a LockingRepository (or one of its subclasses).
 * <p/>
 * The LockingRepository can be initialized with two strategies: <ul><li><em>Optimistic Locking</em> strategy (default):
 * This strategy performs better than the pessimistic one, but you will only discover a concurrency issue at the time a
 * thread tries to save an aggregate. If another thread has saved the same aggregate earlier (but after the first thread
 * loaded its copy), an exception is thrown. The only way to recover from this exception is to load the aggregate from
 * the repository again, replay all actions on it and save it. <li><em>Pessimistic Locking</em> strategy: Pessimistic
 * Locking requires an exclusive lock to be handed to a thread loading an aggregate before the aggregate is handed over.
 * This means that, once an aggregate is loaded, it has full exclusive access to it, until it saves the aggregate. With
 * this strategy, it is important that -no matter what- the aggregate is saved to the repository. Any failure to do so
 * will result in threads blocking endlessly, waiting for a lock that might never be released. </ul>
 * <p/>
 * Important: If an exception is thrown during the saving process, any locks held are released. The calling thread may
 * reattempt saving the aggregate again. If the lock is available, the thread automatically takes back the lock. If,
 * however, another thread has obtained the lock first, a ConcurrencyException is thrown.
