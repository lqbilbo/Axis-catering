/**
 * Utility class that provides operations to read and write event entries for event logs. This class supports both
 * entries for domain events, as well as snapshot events.
 * <p/>
 * DomainEvent entries consist of two components, split by at least one whitespace character: <ul><li>A numeric value
 * indicating the size of the second component, in bytes</li><li>The serialized event object</li></ul>
 * <p/>
 * Snapshot events have an extra component:<ul><li>A numeric value indicating the size of the second component, in
 * bytes</li><li>The number of bytes that may be skipped from the event log when applying this snapshot
 * event</li><li>The serialized snapshot event object</li></ul>
