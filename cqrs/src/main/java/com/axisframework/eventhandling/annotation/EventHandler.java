/**
 * Annotation to be placed on methods that can handle events.
 * <p/>
 * Annotated methods must comply to a few simple rules: <ul> <li>The method must accept 1 or 2 parameter
 * parameters<li>The first parameter must be a subtype of {@link com.axisframework.domain.DomainEvent} <li>If specified,
 * the second parameter must be of type {@link com.axisframework.eventhandling.TransactionStatus}<li>Return values are
 * allowed, but are ignored by dispatchers <li>Exceptions are highly discouraged, and are likely to be caught and
 * ignored by the dispatchers </ul>
 * <p/>
 * For each event, only a single annotated method will be invoked. This method is resolved in the following order <ol>
 * <li>First, the event handler methods of the actual class (at runtime) are searched <li>If a method is found with a
 * parameter that the domain event can be assigned to, it is marked as eligible <li>After a class  has been evaluated
 * (but before any super class), the most specific event handler method is called. That means that if an event handler
 * for a class A and one for a class B are eligible, and B is a subclass of A, then the method with a parameter of type
 * B will be chosen<li>If no method is found in the actual class, its super class is evaluated. <li>If still no method
 * is found, the event listener ignores the event </ol>
 * <p/>
 * If you do not want any events to be ignored, but rather have some logging of the fact that an unhandled event came
 * by, make an abstract superclass that contains an event handler method that accepts {@link
 * com.axisframework.domain.DomainEvent}. <p>Note: if there are two event handler methods accepting the same argument,
 * the behavior is undefined.
