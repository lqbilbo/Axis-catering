 * The {@link #beforeCommandHandling(com.axisframework.commandhandling.CommandContext, com.axisframework.commandhandling.CommandHandler)} method is called before the {@link com.axisframework.commandhandling.CommandHandler}
 * is invoked (but after the CommandHandler has been resolved).
 * <p/>
 * The {@link #afterCommandHandling(com.axisframework.commandhandling.CommandContext, com.axisframework.commandhandling.CommandHandler)} method is called after the command handler
 * invocation.
 * <p/>
 * A CommandHandlerInterceptor may block an incoming command by throwing an Exception. In such case, all
 * CommandHandlerInterceptors that had their {@link #beforeCommandHandling(com.axisframework.commandhandling.CommandContext, com.axisframework.commandhandling.CommandHandler)} method
 * invoked will also have the {@link #afterCommandHandling(com.axisframework.commandhandling.CommandContext, com.axisframework.commandhandling.CommandHandler)} method invoked. The {@link
 * com.axisframework.commandhandling.CommandContext} parameter provides information about whether the CommandHandler was invoked and what the result of
 * the invocation is.
