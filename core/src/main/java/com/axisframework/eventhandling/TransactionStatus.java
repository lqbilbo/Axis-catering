     * cause an unlimited loop in event processing, making an application vulnerable to a poisonous message attack. In

     * RETRY_TRANSACTION} or {@link com.axisframework.eventhandling.RetryPolicy#RETRY_LAST_EVENT RETRY_LAST_EVENT} should be chosen.

     * Furthermore, the policy choice should be based on the effect of a transaction rollback. Some data sources, such
     * as databases, roll back the entire transaction. In that case, choose {@link com.axisframework.eventhandling.RetryPolicy#RETRY_TRANSACTION
     * RETRY_TRANSACTION} policy. If a rollback on the underlying data source only rolls back the last modification,

     * policy.
