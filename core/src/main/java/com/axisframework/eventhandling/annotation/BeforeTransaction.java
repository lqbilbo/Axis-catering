/**
 * Annotation that marks a method to be called before a transactional batch of events is handled. This gives the
 * annotated method the opportunity to prepare resources and start necessary transactions.
 * <p/>
 * Methods annotated by this annotation may have zero or one parameter of type {@link
 * com.axisframework.eventhandling.TransactionStatus}. The transaction status object contains information about the
 * transactional batch. It also provides an option to configure transaction parameters such as batch size.
 * <p/>
 * For each time the annotated method is called, the method annotated with {@link AfterTransaction} will be called too.
 * <p/>
 * For each class hierarchy, only a single method annotated with <code>@BeforeTransaction</code> will be invoked. This
 * is always a method on the most specific class (i.e. subclass) in the hierarchy. If that class contains several
 * annotated methods, the behavior is undefined.
