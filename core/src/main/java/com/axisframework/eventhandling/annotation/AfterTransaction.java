/**
 * Annotation that marks a method to be called after a transactional batch of events is being handled. This gives the
 * annotated method the opportunity to clean up resources and commit or rollback transactions.
 * <p/>
 * Methods annotated by this annotation may have zero or one parameter of type {@link
 * com.axisframework.eventhandling.TransactionStatus}. The transaction status object contains information about the last
 * transaction.
 * <p/>
 * Note that this method is both called when a transactional batch was successfully handled, or when an exception
 * occurred during the batch process. In that case, the TransactionStatus will contain information about the failure.
 * <p/>
 * The AfterTransaction method is called once for every call to a BeforeTransaction method, regardless of the outcome of
 * a transaction.
 * <p/>
 * For each class hierarchy, only a single method annotated with <code>@AfterTransaction</code> will be invoked. This is
 * always a method on the most specific class (i.e. subclass) in the hierarchy. If that class contains several annotated
 * methods, the behavior is undefined.
