/**
 * Represents an event that does not represent a state change of an application but does have functional meaning to the
 * application.
 * <p/>
 * This implementation will maintain a loose reference to the source of the event. However, this source will not be
 * serialized with the event. This means the source will not be available after deserialization. Instead, you can access
 * the {@link #getSourceType() source type} and {@link #getSourceDescription() source description}.
 * <p/>
 * <em>Note</em>: Do not confuse the type of reference used by this class with Java's weak reference. The reference
 * maintained by this event <em>will</em> prevent the garbage collector from cleaning up the source instance. However,
 * the reference will not survive serialization of the event.
 * <p/>
 * <em>Design consideration</em>: Be cautious when using application events. Make sure you did not overlook an
 * opportunity to use a domain event.
